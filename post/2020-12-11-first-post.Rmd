```{R}
#R
library(reticulate)
```


```{python}
#Python
#import pandas as pd
#import seaborn as sns
#df = sns.load_dataset('diamonds')
```

```{R}
#R
#df1<-py$df
#library(ggplot2)
#ggplot()+geom_histogram(df1$carat,df1$price)

```

```{python}
#Python
#import numpy as np
#mat1=np.array([[1,2],[3,4]])

```

```{R}
#R
#mat2<-solve(py$mat1)

```

```{python}
#Python
#np.dot(mat1, mat2).round()

```

```{R}
#I tried repeatedly to get these reticulated chunks to work together but coninued to get an error for each of the python chunks and the R chunks that used information from the python code chunks. I would like to demonstrate that I fully understand how reticulate allows us to switch back and forth between python and R using p$ and r.. By calling back to code from different sections we are able to use seaborn to visualize a dataset that has been manipulated in R and we can do it the other way around as well with ggplot2. I unfortunately don't have the space on my computer to download R so I cannot run R locally at this time. I hope I was able to explain what reticulate and through the code I have above.
